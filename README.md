## Description

A **Simple Blog** is full ASP.NET MVC application that supports users, roles, posts and tags. Application covers most important features of ASP.NET MVC: routing, areas, asset bundling, controllers, the Razor view engine, data binding and validation. Data is being handled using the mature and very powerful nHibernate OR/M to access database; and the Fluent Migrator database migration framework to version database schema in source control. Covered are also security issues - from CSRF and XSS attacks, to making sure errors arenâ€™t displayed to customers. User interface is implemented using both jQuery and Bootstrap 3.

## Usage

**Simple Blog** application covers typical blog engine functionality. This functionality can be divided into two sections:

- frontend usage
- backend usage

**Frontend:**
Homepage displays list of paginated posts, ordered by creation date. Clicking on certain post title, opens posts page. On a sidebar are displayed tag names, and number that shows how many times have certain tag been used in blog posts. Tag field is at the same time a progress bar that presents percentage of tag usage. Clicking on a tag will render posts that are tagged with clicked tag.

**Backend:**
User can login to application going to **/login** page. 
When user with **admin** role logs in, an option for *Posts management* becomes available on the sidebar. Clicking on this option gets user to the admin area of Simple Blog application, where user (*admin*) can manage both *posts* and *users*. 
User can logout going to the **/logout** page.
