## Description

A **Simple Blog** is a full ASP.NET MVC application that supports users, roles, posts, and tags. The application covers the most important features of ASP.NET MVC: routing, areas, asset bundling, controllers, the Razor view engine, data binding, and validation. Data is being handled using the mature and very powerful NHibernate OR/M to access the database, and the Fluent Migrator database migration framework to version database schema in source control. Covered are also security issues - from CSRF and XSS attacks to make sure errors arenâ€™t displayed to customers. The user interface is implemented using both jQuery and Bootstrap 3.

## Usage

**Simple Blog** application covers typical blog engine functionality. This functionality can be divided into two sections:

- frontend usage
- backend usage

**Frontend:**
The homepage displays a list of paginated posts, ordered by creation date. Clicking on certain post title opens posts page. On a sidebar are displayed tag names and number that shows how many times have certain tag been used in blog posts. Tag field is at the same time a progress bar that presents the percentage of tag usage. Clicking on a tag will render posts that are tagged with the clicked tag.

**Backend:**
Users can log in to the application going to **/login** page. 
When a user with **admin** role logs in, an option for *Posts management* becomes available on the sidebar. Clicking on this option gets users to the admin area of Simple Blog application, where users (*admin*) can manage both *posts* and *users*. 
Users can logout going to the **/logout** page.
